      <h3>Our Story</h3>

      <p>
        They met on a cold March evening at a hookah lounge in San Francisco. Both of them came with lifelong friends and the desire for chic conversation. Proud bachelors at the time, neither thought of meeting the person they would one day marry. But once there, Ryan couldn’t take his eyes off Jane.

      <p>
        After losing a race with Jane to the bathroom, Ryan decided to steal her seat. She responded in kind by stealing his seat. As a result of their playground antics, they spent the rest of the night chatting with each other's friends. Although Ryan was having an extraordinary time, Jane remained elusive. So, he swallowed his pride and asked if she was free to meet later that week.

      <p>
        What follows is hard to put into words. I guess you could call it destiny.

      <h3>The Proposal</h3>

      <p>
        In the heart of San Francisco stands Grace Cathedral—famed for its striking architecture, stained glass, and mystical labyrinths. On April 12, 2008, they visited the cathedral together for the first time. While walking the labyrinths, Ryan asked Jane to be his girlfriend. As their relationship blossomed, they often revisited the cathedral to walk the labyrinths to open their hearts, find inner peace, and create a vision for their future.

      <p>
        After touring the world and eventually settling in Seattle, they returned to San Francisco in late 2012 just before the new year. Ryan led Jane back to Grace Cathedral where they once again walked the labyrinths. Quietly contemplating their four-and-a-half year long journey together, Jane reached the center and turned to greet Ryan. Finding him on one knee, she and a few bystanders gasped.

        Ryan proposed and Jane agreed. With tears streaming down their cheeks, they embraced.

      <h3>The Wedding</h3>

      <p>
        Marriage is a commitment between two individuals to jointly pursue the mystery of life with all its twists and turns, joys and sorrows. As we prepared to make this commitment before our loved ones, we realized that many of them would need to travel great distances in order to bare witness.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then we thought, "Since travel is unavoidable for most, why not pick a fun place where guests could relax and make a vacation out of it?" The tropics immediately sprang to mind as its a special place for us—it's where our love for one another has grown and strengthened. While Bali is a spectacular destination, we didn't want to ask our loved ones in the U.S. to travel outside the country. Fortunately, Hawaii is a beautiful and accessible state—one of the top wedding destinations in the world.
      </p>

      <p>
        We'd love for you to join us for a wedding-vacation in Hawaii, though we equally understand if you cannot attend some or all of the fun. Please take a moment to declare your intentions so we can make the necessary arrangements to make your trip a special one.
